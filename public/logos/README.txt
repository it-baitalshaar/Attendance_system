Place the Al Saqiya logo here so it appears in the attendance header when users have the Saqiya theme.

Filename (use exactly):
  al-saqiya-logo.png

Steps:
1. Copy your Al Saqiya logo image (e.g. al_saqiya_logo_page-0001-removebg-preview.png from your assets).
2. Paste it in this folder: Attendance_system/public/logos/
3. Rename it to: al-saqiya-logo.png

Recommended: PNG with transparent background, width around 200–400px so it stays sharp on the blue header bar.
